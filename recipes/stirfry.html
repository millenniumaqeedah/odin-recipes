    <p>A great bodybuilder meal, at home delicacy...you name it!</p>
    <p>This classic beef stir-fry recipe is the perfect way to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients. This beef and broccoli dish comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them!</p>

    <p>This stir fry is packed with strips of beef steak, veggies, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.</p>

<strong><p>Stir Fry</p></strong>
<p>The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.</p>
<p>After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer.</p>
